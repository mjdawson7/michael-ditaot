that currently has a field to allow all reporting, including restarts,
to be controlled according to predefined sets. A 'minimal' preset
is introduced in this release, and configures the simulation output
to a basic set. The purpose of this feature is to provide a simple
mechanism to override existing report controls, achieve improved simulation
performance, and reduce disk space use.</p>
